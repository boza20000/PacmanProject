# ðŸŸ¡ Console Pac-Man Game

A console-based implementation of **Pac-Man** written in C++. The game is played entirely in the terminal and features four ghosts with unique behaviors, mimicking the original game mechanics.

---

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Overview

- You play as **Pac-Man (P)** navigating a closed map.
- Four ghosts (Red, Pink, Blue, Green) are released at different score thresholds.
- The objective is to **collect all 4 apples (`@`)** while avoiding the ghosts.
- The map is generated based on the dimensions **you input at the start** (width Ã— height).

---

## ðŸ§± How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter two numbers (e.g. `20 10`) for the map's width and height.
3. Use **arrow keys or WASD** to move Pac-Man around the grid.
4. Eat:
   - `.` (points) â€” 1 point
   - `@` (apple) â€” 20 points
5. Ghosts appear based on your score:
   - **Red Ghost (Blinky)** â€“ active from the start, follows you directly.
   - **Pink Ghost (Pinky)** â€“ appears at 20 points, uses a predictive path.
   - **Blue Ghost (Inky)** â€“ appears at 40 points, uses Pac-Man + Blinky vector.
   - **Green Ghost (Clyde)** â€“ appears at 60 points, chases or retreats based on distance.
6. **Win condition**: Collect all 4 apples.
7. **Lose condition**: A ghost catches Pac-Man.
